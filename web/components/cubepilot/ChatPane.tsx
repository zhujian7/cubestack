// 聊天 tab — the unified conversation surface for inference models and the
// CubePilot agent, mirroring public/chat.html: object list (gateway models
// + AI assistant) | chat card. The chat card fills the viewport height, the
// thread scrolls inside its own scrollbar, and the composer is a floating bar
// docked at the very bottom; sampling params (model mode) collapse into a
// chip in the composer's bottom row and open in a popover.
// There is no context rail: the instance phase/model line lives in the card
// header, and the config tab owns the policy/allowlist detail.
//
// Model side: the object list is the real model catalog from the AI Gateway
// (/api/cubepilot/playground/services → gateway /v1/models), and replies are
// real streamed completions proxied through /api/cubepilot/playground/chat
// (SSE).
//
// Agent side: the real CubePilot agent API (docs/cubepilot/api.md). The
// conversation is the SSE stream of POST /api/v1/messages proxied through
// /api/cubepilot/pilot; sessions, history, and the HITL approval/question
// channels are the same proxy. Instance status, the model in use, and the
// tool whitelist (platform skills) come from the agent CRs via the
// /api/cubepilot/agent/* + /api/cubepilot/skills routes. On (re)select the
// client restores the user's one fixed conversation (history + pending HITL
// cards) — see SESSION_KEY — and polls history while a turn is still in flight
// after a reload.
